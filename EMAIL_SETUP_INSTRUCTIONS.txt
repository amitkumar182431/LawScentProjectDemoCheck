EMAIL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR JOB APPLICATION FORM
=================================================

OVERVIEW:
This document explains how to set up email functionality for the job application form in job.html to send submissions to amitamit182431@gmail.com.

REQUIRED SETUP:
1. EmailJS Account Setup
2. Email Service Configuration
3. Template Creation
4. Integration with the form

STEP-BY-STEP SETUP:

1. CREATE EMAILJS ACCOUNT:
   - Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Verify your email address

2. ADD EMAIL SERVICE:
   - In EmailJS dashboard, go to "Email Services"
   - Click "Add New Service"
   - Choose Gmail (or your preferred email provider)
   - Connect your Gmail account (amitamit182431@gmail.com)
   - Follow the OAuth authentication process
   - Note down your Service ID (e.g., "service_xxxxxxxx")

3. CREATE EMAIL TEMPLATE:
   - Go to "Email Templates" in dashboard
   - Click "Create New Template"
   - Set template name (e.g., "Job Application Notification")
   - Configure the template with these variables:
     
     Subject: New Job Application - {{position}}
     
     Body:
     Hello,
     
     A new job application has been received:

     Best regards,

4. GET YOUR PUBLIC KEY:
   - Go to "Account" -> "API Keys"
   - Copy your Public Key (starts with "user_xxxxxxxxx")

5. UPDATE THE CODE:
   Replace the placeholder values in job.html:
   
   Line ~163: Replace "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY" with your actual EmailJS public key
   Line ~352: Replace "YOUR_SERVICE_ID" with your actual service ID
   Line ~352: Replace "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID" with your actual template ID

EXAMPLE OF FINAL CONFIGURATION:
<script type="text/javascript">
    (function(){
        emailjs.init("user_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0"); // Your actual public key
    })();
</script>

emailjs.send('service_xyz123', 'template_abc456', templateParams)

TESTING:
1. Save all changes to job.html
2. Open the file in a browser
3. Fill out the form with test data
4. Submit the form
5. Check if email is received at amitamit182431@gmail.com

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If emails don't send, check browser console for errors
- Ensure all EmailJS credentials are correct
- Verify the connected Gmail account has proper permissions
- Check EmailJS dashboard for delivery logs

LIMITATIONS:
- Previous EmailJS solution couldn't handle file attachments
- For file attachments, a backend server solution is required

NEW SOLUTION:
- Created a Node.js server (server.js) that handles form submissions and file uploads
- Server uses Express, Multer for file handling, and Nodemailer for email
- File attachments are now properly sent with the email
- Server stores temporary uploads in ./uploads/ folder

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS:
1. Use a backend service (Node.js/PHP) with Nodemailer or PHPMailer
2. Integrate with Formspree or similar form services
3. Use Google Apps Script for email automation
4. Implement a serverless function (AWS Lambda, Firebase Functions)

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Never expose private API keys in client-side code
- Validate all form inputs on both client and server side
- Implement rate limiting to prevent spam
- Consider CAPTCHA for bot prevention
- Store sensitive data securely if using a database
